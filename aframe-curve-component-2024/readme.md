This is the Aframe Curve Component 2024 Update.
The previous version othe A-Frame Curve Component was out of date, not working because it utilized threejs Geometry which is depreciated, and it was archived by it's creator who I was unable to contact. I had to update it to utilize BufferGeometry.

## aframe-curve-component 2024 Update

A Curve component to draw curves in A-Frame. The component consists of multiple components:

* curve: Draws a certain type of a curve and consists of multiple "curve-points"
* curve-point: Defines the curve based on it's position. Multiple entities are added as children of the curve-entity.
* draw-curve: Add's a Mesh to the curve to visualize it
* clone-along-curve: Clones an Entity along the curve (e.g. to build a race track based on track parts)

For [A-Frame](https://aframe.io).

Credits: Initial concept and development has been done by [AdaRoseEdwards](https://github.com/SamsungInternet/a-frame-components/blob/master/dist/curve.js).

### Installation

#### Browser

Install and use by directly including the [browser files](dist):

```html
<head>
  <title>My A-Frame Scene</title>
  <script src="https://rawgit.com/aframevr/aframe/master/dist/aframe-master.min.js"></script>
  <script src=""></script>
</head>

<body>
  <a-scene>
    <a-curve id="track1">
        <a-curve-point position="-1 1 -3"></a-curve-point>
        <a-curve-point position="1 1 -3"></a-curve-point>
    </a-curve>
    
    <!-- Draw the Curve -->
    <a-draw-curve curveref="#track1" material="shader: line; color: blue;"></a-draw-curve>
    
    <!-- Clone a Box along the Curve -->
    <a-entity clone-along-curve="curve: #track1; spacing: 0.2; scale: 1 1 1; rotation: 0 0 0;" geometry="primitive:box; height:0.1; width:0.2; depth:0.1"></a-entity>
  </a-scene>
</body>
```

<!-- If component is accepted to the Registry, uncomment this. -->
<!--
Or with [angle](https://npmjs.com/package/angle/), you can install the proper
version of the component straight into your HTML file, respective to your
version of A-Frame:

```sh
angle install aframe-curve-component
```
-->

#### npm

Install via npm:

```bash
npm install aframe-curve-component
```

Then require and use.

```js
require('aframe');
require('aframe-curve-component');
```

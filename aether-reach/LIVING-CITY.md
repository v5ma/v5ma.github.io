# Living Ward — v0.5 candidate

This expands the same Aether Reach map; it is not another game or a scene reset. Two southern districts, three walkable connections and a new courier rail join the original five districts and seven freight lines. The original relay expedition, weapons, upgrade economy, loot, Foldwing and device adapters remain.

## What exists

Seven world-space interiors: Copper Cup café, its below-deck pump vault, Old Customs, Sel's conservatory, Civic Hall, Lantern Watch and the Skywright hangar. The service stairs and gates use real collision geometry; rooms are not menus or loading portals. Eight named interactable characters, six walking townspeople and three cats provide the beginning of city life. Original placeholder dialogue does not adapt any private manuscript.

Eight civic stories interconnect: recover a cat, repair the basement pump, resolve stolen cargo through evidence and a voluntary return, get a permit, learn a glyph pattern, deliver a parcel by air, choose optional adult companionship, and report the original relay restoration. The permit physically opens the hangar. These are explicit authored states, not open-ended generated conversations. Citizens cannot be harmed, and the Watch/broker story is not a simulated police/wanted system. The romance is an initial mutually chosen dialogue relationship; friendship remains an equally valid option and has no lesser XP payout.

XP yields character levels and spendable points in Vigor, Aviation and Resonance. J opens the journal. V casts Mend after Sel's glyph lesson; the spell consumes energy and has a cooldown. Coffee and tonic purchases use existing in-game credits. Previous version-1 checkpoints migrate without discarding weapons or relay progress.

The Kestrel courier skiff is a pilotable VTOL craft after a permit. E boards/parks, movement steers, Space rises and C descends; controller jump/reverse provide lift/descent actions. Park at a marked pad before disembarking. Its collision is an approximate cabin envelope and the map has a defined airspace boundary. It is not a full flight simulator. Skiff placement resets to its home pad when loading a checkpoint; civic objectives and attributes persist.

## Art and verification boundaries

More detailed curved primitives, articulated faces/limbs/cats, batched architectural detail, interior lights, flooring, handrails, pipes, furniture and a modeled twin-balloon craft replace empty lower floors and add visible street activity. Decorative small furniture is not entirely physical. The low/mobile profile remains lower detail. Physical Quest frame time and comfort must be measured; higher polygon counts are not a performance claim.

New pure tests seed states to isolate mechanics. Native city tests use only real keyboard/menu interactions and read-only snapshots. This candidate is not called deployed until those flows, the existing regressions, public-byte verification and release backup have completed. See the PR evidence for the current result.
